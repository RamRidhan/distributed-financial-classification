        "\n",
        "We developed a machine learning pipeline to classify S&P 500 stocks into five performance categories (Poor to Strong) using fundamental financial ratios and macroeconomic indicators. Below is a summary of our approach in six key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Objective**  \n",
        "   - We aimed to classify S&P 500 stocks into `five performance categories` using financial and macroeconomic data, leveraging Apache Spark for distributed computing and H2O AutoML for automated model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Preprocessing**  \n",
        "   - We loaded data from Google Cloud Storage, joined financial and macro datasets, `removed` null values, `filtered` out the SPX Index, `remapped` scores (1–5 to 0–4), and `cached` the DataFrame for efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Class Imbalance Handling**  \n",
        "   - We addressed class imbalance by **oversampling minority classes** to match the majority class count or used KMeans clustering (5 clusters) to oversample minority classes within financial archetypes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Feature Engineering**  \n",
        "   - We assembled and scaled features using `VectorAssembler` and `StandardScaler`. For the clustering-based approach, we added lagged features, volatility metrics, and interaction terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Model Training**  \n",
        "   - We trained H2O AutoML with up to `8 GBM/XGBoost models`, optimizing for AUC, balancing classes, and saved the best model and predictions to Google Cloud Storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Evaluation and Insights**  \n",
        "   - We evaluated performance using `accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, visualized results` with confusion matrices and PCA plots, and analyzed feature importance using H2O varimp and SHAP.\n",

        "The standard oversampling approach achieves a high accuracy of 0.897 and a macro-average F1-score of 0.894, indicating robust and balanced performance across all classes. It performs exceptionally well for middle classes (Marginal Poor, Neutral, Marginal Strong) with precision and recall exceeding 0.94, suggesting it effectively captures the majority of stock performance patterns. However, its slightly lower recall for the Strong class (0.698) indicates it may miss some top-performing stocks, which could limit its utility in scenarios prioritizing the identification of high performers.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Cluster-Based Oversampling**  \n",
        "   - We defined a function to oversample minority classes `(scores 2, 3, 4)` within each of `five KMeans clusters`, sampling with replacement (frac=3.0) and concatenating results for balanced data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Selection**  \n",
        "   - We used `51 features, excluding `stock`, `date`, and `score`, including financial ratios, macroeconomic indicators`, and engineered features like lagged metrics and interaction terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Data Splitting**  \n",
        "   - We split the data into **70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing using random sampling** with a fixed seed, ensuring robust model evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **H2O AutoML Training**  \n",
        "   - We initialized H2O with `4GB memory, trained AutoML with 8 GBM/XGBoost models (1200s runtime)`, optimized for AUC, and balanced classes with sampling factors [1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0].\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Model Evaluation**  \n",
        "   - We achieved **57.3% accuracy, 62.4% precision (Strong), 7.1% precision (Poor)**, 72.5% recall (Strong), 0.271 F1-score (avg), and 0.488 ROC-AUC, with predictions saved as parquet files.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Visualization and Feature Importance**  \n",

        "The clustering-based oversampling model, with an accuracy of 0.573 and a macro-average F1-score of 0.271, underperforms significantly compared to the standard approach. Its low precision (0.09–0.15) and recall (0.01–0.03) for classes 1–3 (Marginal Poor, Neutral, Marginal Strong) highlight a critical weakness in handling minority classes, likely due to the complexity introduced by clustering and oversampling within archetypes. This suggests that the clustering approach, while innovative, disrupts the model’s ability to generalize across less frequent classes.\n",
